something new to learn
Hello! I am new to coding and am excited, yet nervous, to venture in to a new world.  I am in the helping field and deal more with people, emotions, feelings and thoughts and less with machines and technology.  Hopefully this will be something that I can become comfortable with and not be intimidated by it all.  Wish me luck!
